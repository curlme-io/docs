title: "A terminal-first alternative to RequestBin"
description: "How curlme compares to traditional request capture tools like RequestBin and Webhook.site."
---

## Overview

Tools like RequestBin and Webhook.site pioneered the "throwaway endpoint" concept. They are excellent for quick visual checks or when you need a public URL to receive a one-off payload.

However, for developers building and debugging APIs, the dashboard-centric model introduces friction.

## Where Traditional Tools Break Down

1. **Context Switching**: You spend more time in your browser than in your code.
2. **Manual Replay**: To test a fix, you often have to manually copy data into `curl` or Postman.
3. **Transient Data**: Many free versions of these tools don't offer persistent storage or easy sharing within teams without upgrade paths.

## When curlme is a Better Fit

**curlme** is built for developers who live in the terminal.

- **You want to stay in your IDE**: Run `curlme listen` in a side terminal and watch traffic while you code.
- **You need to local-test**: Use `curlme replay` to forward captured production traffic to `localhost:3000` with one command.
- **You need to compare**: Built-in `diff` commands let you see exactly what changed between two webhook versions.

## When it's Not a Fit

To be honest, curlme might not be for everyone:
- If you need a **rich visual editor** to build complex JSON payloads, a dashboard-first tool might be better.
- If you are a **non-technical user** who just needs to see if a link was clicked, the terminal interface might feel unnecessary.

## Comparison at a Glance

| Feature | RequestBin / Others | curlme |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Interface** | Web Dashboard | CLI (Terminal) |
| **Workflow** | Capture → View → Copy → Replay | Capture → Listen → Replay |
| **Local Testing** | Requires manual setup | Integrated `replay` command |
| **Philosophy** | Visualization first | Speed and terminal-native |

If you find yourself constantly copying headers from a browser tab into your terminal, curlme was built for you.
