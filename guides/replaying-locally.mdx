title: "Replaying production requests locally"

When a bug only happens in production, the first step is always trying to reproduce it locally. Context switching between production logs and local environments is a major source of friction.

## The Workflow

### 1. Capture the issue
Keep a "production-debug" bin active and point a portion of your traffic or a specific hook toward it.
```bash
curlme bin use production-debug
```

### 2. Identify the failure
Use the dashboard or `curlme listen` to find the specific request that caused the error. Let's say it's `rq_990011`.

### 3. Bring it home
Instead of manually copying the JSON body and headers into a `curl` command, use the replay feature.
```bash
curlme replay rq_990011 --to http://localhost:8080/debug
```

## Why it's more reliable
- **No data loss**: Manually copying can lead to character encoding issues or missing hidden headers.
- **Consistent environment**: Replaying through curlme ensures the `Content-Type` and other crucial metadata remain identical to the original delivery.
- **Speed**: You can replay a request in seconds, keeping your focus on the code fix.

**This is where curlme helps**: It makes production payloads as accessible as local ones.
