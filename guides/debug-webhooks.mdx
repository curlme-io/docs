## The Webhook Debugging Loop

Traditional webhook debugging often looks like this:
1. Trigger an event in an external service (e.g., Stripe, GitHub).
2. Switch to a browser tab.
3. Refresh a dashboard to see if the request arrived.
4. Copy the payload.
5. Paste it into a local script or tool.
6. Make a change, and repeat.

Every time you switch context from your IDE to a browser, you lose focus.

## Why Dashboards Slow You Down

Dashboards are great for visualization, but they are a bottleneck for development. They require manual interaction, UI navigation, and copying/pasting. 

**curlme** is designed to keep you in the terminal.

## How curlme Fits Your Flow

Instead of a browser-based dashboard, use the CLI to create an endpoint and listen for traffic instantly.

### 1. Create a Bin
```bash
curlme bin create my-webhook
```

### 2. Listen in Real-time
```bash
curlme listen
```

As soon as a request hits your endpoint, the CLI displays the headers and body. You can inspect the data, replay it to a local server, or diff it with a previous request—all without touching your mouse.

## CLI-First Efficiency

- **Instant Visibility**: No refreshing; requests stream directly to your stdout.
- **Interactive Inspection**: Use keyboard shortcuts to drill into payloads.
- **Zero Infrastructure**: No need to configure tunnels or permanent servers for a 5-minute debug session.
