Stripe webhooks are notorious for being tricky to debug due to signature verification and complex JSON structures. Here is how you debug them efficiently using curlme.

## 1. Create a Stripe Bin
Start by creating a dedicated bin for your Stripe events.
```bash
curlme bin create stripe-test
```

## 2. Configure Stripe
Go to your Stripe Dashboard and add a new webhook endpoint.
- **URL**: `https://curlme.io/h/stripe-test`
- **Events**: `payment_intent.succeeded` (or any event you're testing)

## 3. Listen for the Event
In your terminal, start listening:
```bash
curlme listen
```

## 4. Trigger the Webhook
Fire a test event from Stripe. You'll see the request appear in your terminal immediately.
```
→ POST /h/stripe-test [200] rq_f8a3b2
```

## 5. Verify and Replay
Check the headers to find the `Stripe-Signature`. If your local code is failing signature verification, you can now:
1. Inspect the raw body with `curlme show rq_f8a3b2`.
2. Start your local server.
3. Replay the request to your local endpoint:
```bash
curlme replay rq_f8a3b2 --to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

This ensures you are testing with the exact payload and headers Stripe sent, without having to repeatedly trigger events from their dashboard.

**This is where curlme helps**: It bridges the gap between Stripe's cloud and your local terminal.
