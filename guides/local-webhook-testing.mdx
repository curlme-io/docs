## The "Tunnel Exhaustion" Problem

Tools like ngrok are standard for exposing local servers to the internet. However, they can be complex to configure for complex shared environments, and they don't always give you a historical record of what was sent.

If you don't need a live persistent tunnel, there is a faster way.

## Capture First, Replay Second

Instead of exposing your local machine, use curlme as a buffer. 

1. **Capture**: Point your webhook provider (Stripe, GitHub, etc.) to a curlme bin.
2. **Inspect**: Verify the request structure in your terminal with `curlme listen`.
3. **Replay**: Send that exact request to your local server whenever you're ready.

## Workflow Example

### 1. Set up the capture point
```bash
# Create a new bin
curlme bin create dev-capture
```
*Configure your service to send webhooks to `https://curlme.io/h/dev-capture`.*

### 2. Stream and Inspect
```bash
curlme listen
```
Watch the traffic come in. If a request looks problematic, note its ID (e.g., `rq_f8a3b2`).

### 3. Replay to Localhost
When you've started your local development server on port 3000:
```bash
curlme replay rq_f8a3b2 --to http://localhost:3000/api/webhook
```

## Why this works
- **No public exposure**: You don't need to keep a tunnel open to the internet.
- **Repeatable**: You can replay the same request 100 times while fixing a bug.
- **Disconnected**: You can capture requests on the go and replay them later when you're back at your desk.

This approach targets the pain of managing tunnels without competing directly—it's about adding a persistent, inspectable layer to your local dev flow.
