## Overview

Inspection is the core of debugging. When a request fails, you need to know exactly what was sent: headers, query parameters, and the raw body. 

curlme turns your terminal into a live request logger.

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize your environment
```bash
curlme bin create debug-session
```

### 2. Live Inspection
Run the listen command to see requests in real-time.
```bash
curlme listen
```

## Anatomy of an Inspection

When a request arrives, curlme provides:
- **Timestamp**: When the request hit our servers.
- **Method & Path**: The HTTP Verb and the specific URI.
- **Headers**: Complete header list (including user agents, auth tokens, etc.).
- **Body**: Automatically formatted JSON or raw text.

## Useful Patterns

### Filtering by Method
Only interested in `POST` requests?
```bash
curlme listen --method POST
```

### Inspecting the Latest Request
If you missed the stream, just grab the most recent one:
```bash
curlme latest
```

### Deep Dive into a Specific Request
Use a request ID for full details:
```bash
curlme show rq_a1b2c3
```

## Keep it Terminal-First
The goal of curlme is to keep your tooling close to your code. By inspecting HTTP traffic in the terminal, you can easily pipe output to other commands, grep for specific keys, or log results to local files.
