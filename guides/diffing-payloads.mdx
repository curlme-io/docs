title: "Diffing webhook payloads during a breaking change"
description: "How to compare two requests to identify schema changes or regression bugs."
---

Upgrading an API or changing a webhook schema is dangerous. Small changes in field names or data types can break downstream consumers. Visual diffing is the fastest way to spot these changes.

## The Scenario

You have an existing webhook (`rq_old`) and a new version (`rq_new`) after an update. You need to see exactly what changed.

## The CLI Workflow

### 1. Identify the requests
List your recent requests to find the two you want to compare.
```bash
curlme listen
```

### 2. Run the diff
Compare them directly in your terminal.
```bash
curlme diff rq_old rq_new
```

### 3. Analyze the output
The CLI will highlight:
- **Added fields**: Green (`+`)
- **Removed fields**: Red (`-`)
- **Modified values**: Yellow

## Why this matters
- **Regression testing**: Verify that an update didn't accidentally drop a field.
- **Collaborative debugging**: Share a diff with a teammate to explain why a specific integration is failing.
- **Precision**: Moving beyond "it looks the same" to knowing exactly which byte changed.

**This is where curlme helps**: It brings visual precision to terminal-first workflows.
